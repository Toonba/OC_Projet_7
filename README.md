# OC_Projet_7 : Develop a search algorithm in JavaScript

For this project me play the role of a freelancer who have just been commissioned by the company “Les Petits Plats” as a Front-end Developer for a 3-month mission.

Our first mission is to implement the search functionality from uses cases that have been given. To quickly sum up these uses cases are composed of 4 scenario and 1 details about the feature : Search returns must be an intersection of results.

We were also asked to develop two version for our search functionality : 
- using native loops (while, for...)
- using functional programming with array object methods (foreach, filter, map, reduce).

Both version can be found in this project. 

You can see the result by following this [link](https://toonba.github.io/OC_Projet_7/)
